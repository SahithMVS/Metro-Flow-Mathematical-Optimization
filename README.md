# Metro-Flow-Mathematical-Optimization

MetroFlow is a public subway operator that runs high-frequency rail services across both urban and suburban routes. Like many transportation agencies worldwide, MetroFlow faces increasing pressure from:

📈 Growing ridership demand

⚡️ Rising energy prices

🧾 Fixed budgets and limited infrastructure

🛠️ Aging rolling stock requiring higher maintenance costs

Balancing cost efficiency with service quality is critical for sustainable operation in this context. This project simulates a real-world decision problem often encountered in urban transit planning:

"Given a limited fleet of trains and cars, how can we schedule daily operations to maximize profit, meet at least 85% of passenger demand, and stay within resource limits like energy and maintenance budgets?"


A real-world transportation optimization model built using Excel Solver and Python (PuLP).  
Project done as part of SCM518 Final at W. P. Carey School of Business.

## 🔧 Objective
Maximize daily profit by optimizing train car allocation and trip frequency across 4 subway routes during rush/non-rush hours.

## 💡 Key Results
- ✅ Profit increased from $14K to $28.7K
- 📉 Reduced energy and maintenance costs
- 📊 85% of passenger demand satisfied
